            The goal of this app is to create a platform for users to manage their contact lens usage. It helps users determine when to buy new lenses and, for those using monthly or bi-weekly lenses, it provides reminders to change them on the appropriate day. Users can also track their lens usage statistics.

            Additionally, the app includes features such as news related to vision, a map indicating nearby optical stores, the option to contact a professional for assistance, an in-app store, a blog for users to share their experiences, and more.
